## Project Summary

In this repo you will find my solution to the Ada Front-end 3 part challenge. The project specs were to connect to a local database, display data from the database while adhering to layout, create a search filter functionality and finally to build an interactive component that renders content using template strings. 

### Challenges

Naturally As a dev with a year of experience in React and just a dev in general, I ran into many bugs and challenges while building out my solutions. I did my best to deliever great functionality to this app but I did miss the mark on a few things. Here are a list of challenges I faced:

1. Setting up local database - I spent way too long trying to figure out how to fetch an url from a local database, I decided to use placeholder data instead. In hindsight it would have been better to ask directly for the sake of time management 

2. Search filter - retrieving data from form, updating in state, filtering through array data and displaying a result was also a challenge that took more time than I anticipated 


### Future Functionality

As you will see there is a lot of missing functionality in this app. I will need to refine my search function, get my node connections to interact in accordance to the guildlines (collapsing when another one is open). I also need to set up my detail view to display data from the sidebar and render content with template strings. 


### Final Thoughts/Comments

This was a real challenge for me as a developer, I learned a lot and I will be finishing what I started here (in a separate repo). If you are still reading thank you for taking the time to consider me as a candidate!
